				<p class="parParagraph">Sukyo Mahikari aims to provide opportunities for people to further their spiritual growth, helping them to grasp the existence of God and the principles that govern the universe, through their own experience.</p>

				<p class="parParagraph">Our aim is to help make possible a world filled with love and harmony where people will be able to overcome the boundaries and challenges facing them today. In such a world, people will naturally love, care for and respect one another as co-habitants of this precious planet, Earth.</p>

				<p class="parParagraph">Our organisation cooperates with others in society who share a similar vision of a world where a spiritual outlook is naturally integrated with humankind’s material development and progress.</p>
