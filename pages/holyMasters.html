Since then, we have referred to him as Sukuinushisama.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">Sukuinushisama was guided by revelations from God on many occasions. He was instructed to share the experience of <a href="artSpiritualPurification.html">spiritual purification through the Light of God</a> with as many people as possible and he devoted the final 15 years of his life to transmitting this gift throughout the world.</p>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
					<p class="parParagraph">It was his aim that people discover the joy of helping others, and that everyone experience lasting happiness in their lives. He wanted to help establish a heaven-like civilisation on earth.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">On 13 June 1974 Sukuinushisama received a revelation to transfer his roles and missions to his adopted daughter and disciple, Keishu Okada. She therefore took on the role as the second spiritual leader and the title Oshienushisama.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">Sukuinushisama passed to the 'realm of divine spirits' on 23 June 1974 and his daughter went on to fulfil the role as spiritual leader for the next 35 years.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">In October 2002, through revelation, her adopted son Ko-o (pronounced &quot;K-or-or&quot;) Okada became her official assistant.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">On 3 November 2009, as a result of divine revelation, it was announced that he had succeeded to all the roles and missions of the second spiritual leader and become the third spiritual leader of the Sukyo Mahikari organisation.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">Sukyo Mahikari has therefore evolved through 3 stages as an organisation.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">Sukuinushisama, in the first stage, pioneered the practice of spiritual purification and the establishment and expansion of the organisation around the world.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">The second spiritual leader continued the holy missions in the second stage, and completed the following constructions, in or near Takayama:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p class="parParagraph">The World Shrine, a place for communication with the Creator God, for all humankind</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="parParagraph">The Shrine of Light, dedicated to Sukuinushisama</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="parParagraph">The Hikaru Museum, open to the public with exhibits concerning the Founder; ancient history; and an art gallery.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="parParagraph">The Youth Hall</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="parParagraph">The third stage of the organisation began in 2002, when Ko-o (&quot;K-or-or&quot;) Okada began his mission to support the second spiritual leader in an active up-front role. The emphasis during this third stage has been on the genuine practice of divine principles in daily life, in order to discover our true potential and purpose as human beings.</p>
					<p class="parParagraph">Since 1959, the practice of spiritual purification with <a href="artSpiritualPurification.html">God’s Light</a> has spread rapidly throughout the world. <a href="contactUs.html">Sukyo Mahikari Centres</a> are open to the public in order for people to experience purification through the giving and receiving of the Light of God.</p>
